    //It moves down slightly, then stays and moves slowly to the right edge of the screen, then bounces to the left, and repeat. (check)
    //Unique attacks from normal lasers, to scatter shot, Laser Beam, and the occasional missile that explodes. THEY DO NOT HOME IN ON THE PLAYER.
    //Boss HP is 25, add/subtract as necessary during testing.
    //Make the boss blink with each hit, and add the damage visuals. Three or four total. 

    // When the boss fight starts, shrink the player by half of its ordinary size.
